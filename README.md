# Getting started

> Welcome to my homework assignment page. Please find my first three week project below.



### First Week:

- Prepare each class by reading the [wiki](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub/wiki) preparation work called [Prep Work (for week 1)](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub/wiki/Prep-Work-wk-1)
- During class, be focus, ask questions as much as you can, help your teammates when they are struggling.


## Second Week:

If only four hours a week were enough to learn web development!  But sadly it's not :(  Along side coming to class, you will have homework assignments.

## Third Week:

1. [responsive Web Designer site](./homework/week-3-project)
