    Rules of the game
    </header>



    <div>

    The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. You are X, 
    your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting
    their marks in empty squares.  The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row
    (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, 
    the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
