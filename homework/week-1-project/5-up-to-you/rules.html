<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. </li><br>
    <li>You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. </li><br>
    <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. </li><br>
    <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li><br>
