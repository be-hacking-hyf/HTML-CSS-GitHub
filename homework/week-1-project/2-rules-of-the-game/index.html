<h2>How you can play tic-tac-toe?</h2>

<p>Tic-tac-toe is a fun game that you can play
   any time and anywhere as long as you have
    a piece of paper, a pencil, and an 
    opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a zero sum game,
     which means that if both players are 
     playing their best, that neither player
      will win. However, if you learn how to 
      play tic-tac-toe and master some simple
       strategies, then you'll be able to not 
       only play, but to win the majority of
        the time. If you want to know how to 
        play tic-tac-toe, then see Step 1 to
         get started</p>

  <h3>Step 1</h3> 
       <p>
        <strong><em>Draw the board.</em></strong> First, you have to 
          draw the board, which is made up of 
          3 x 3 grid of squares. This means it 
          has three rows of three squares. Some
           people play with a 4 x 4 grid, but
            that is for more advanced players,
             and we will focus on the 3 x 3 grid
              here</p>

       <h3>Step 2</h3>
              <p><strong><em>Have the first player go first.</em></strong>
                 Though traditionally, the first player 
                 goes with "X", you can allow the first
                  player to decide whether he wants to go 
                  with "X"s or "O"s. These symbols will
                   be placed on the table, in the attempt 
                   to have three of them in a row. If
                    you're going first, then the best move
                     you can make is to move into the 
                     center. This will maximize your 
                     chances of winning, since you'll be
                      able to create a row of three "X"s or
                       "O"s in more combinations (4) this
                        way than if you chose a different 
                        square.</p>

                        <h3>Step 3</h3>  
     <p><strong><em>Have the second player go second.</em></strong>
        After the first player goes, then the
         second player should put down his symbol,
          which will be different from the symbol 
          of the first player. The second player 
          
          can either try to block the first player 
          from creating a row of three, or focus on
           creating his or her own row of three.
            Ideally, the player can do both. </p>

             <h3>Step 4</h3>
<p><strong><em>Keep alternating moves until one of the 
  players has drawn a row of three symbols or
   until no one can win.</em></strong> The first player to 
   
   draw three of his or her symbols in a row, 
   whether it is horizontal, vertical, or 
   diagonal, has won tic-tac-toe. However, if
    both players are playing with optimal 
    strategy, then there's a good chance that
     no one will win because you will have 
     blocked all of each other's opportunities 
     to create a row of three. </p>

      <h3>Step 5</h3>
<p><strong><em>Keep practicing.</em></strong> Contrary 
  to popular belief, tic-tac-toe isn't purely
   a game of chance. There are some strategies 
   that can help you optimize your skills and
    to become an expert tic-tac-toe player. If
     you keep playing, you'll soon learn all of 
     the tricks to making sure you win every 
     time -- or, at least, you'll learn the 
     tricks to make sure you never lose. Its 
     like 0's and x's.
