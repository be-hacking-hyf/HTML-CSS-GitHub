  <h3>Tic-tac-toe game</h3>
    <p>Players soon discover that the best play from both parties
       leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often played by
        young children, who often have not yet discovered the
         optimal strategy.</p>

        <p>Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe,
         it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching
          the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of
           artificial intelligence that deals with the searching
            of game trees. It is straightforward to write a
            computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly 
            or to enumerate the 765 essentially different
             positions (the state space complexity) or the 
             26,830 possible games up to rotations and
              reflections (the game tree complexity) on 
              this space.</p>
        
       <p> The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in 
        which two players alternate placing stones of their
         own color on an m√ón board, with the goal of getting 
         k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the
          (3,3,3)-game.[2] Harary's generalized tic-tac-toe
           is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe.
            It can also be generalized as a nd game. 
            Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3
             and d equals 2.[3] If played properly,
              the game will end in a draw, making 
              tic-tac-toe a futile game.[4] </p>
