                or the computer is "O". Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
            <li>3-After the first player goes, then the second player should put down his symbol, which will be different
                from the symbol of the first player. </li>
            <li>4-The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row whether it is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal is the
