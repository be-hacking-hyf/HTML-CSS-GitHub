  My country is called <strong>Burundi</strong>.<br>
  It is an <em>East African</em> country without access to the sea, but with a large shoreline on Lake Tanganyika.<br>
  it is located in the Great Lakes region and surrounded by the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west, Rwanda to the north, and Tanzania to the east and south.<br> 
  Its capital is, since February 4, 2019, Gitega. Bujumbura, the former capital and the most populous city in the country, is the economic capital.
</p>Burundi's economy is predominantly rural and is based on agricultural exports and livestock.<br> 
Agricultural production is divided between products for export, such as coffee, tea and cotton, and food crops.<br> 
The coffee sector is the country's leading resource (80% of exports).<br> 
Burundi is also the eighth in the list of African tea producers at the beginning of the decade 2010, dominated by Kenya.<p>
