<h4 class="isgreen">About Burundi</h4>
</div>
<p>One of the smallest countries in Africa, Burundi is landlocked and has an equatorial climate. Burundi is a part of the Albertine Rift, the western extension of the East African Rift.<br> 
The country lies on a rolling plateau in the centre of Africa. Burundi is bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and southeast, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west.<br>

The average elevation of the central plateau is 1,707 m (5,600 ft), with lower elevations at the borders. The highest peak, Mount Heha at 2,685 m (8,810 ft), lies to the southeast of the former capital Bujumbura (and west of the current capital Gitega).<br> 
The source of the Nile River is in Bururi province, and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the Ruvyironza River.<br> 
Lake Victoria is also an important water source, which serves as a fork to the Kagera River.<br> 
Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika, located in much of Burundi's southwestern corner.</p>

<h5 class="cool">People</h5>
</div>
<p>As of July 2016, Burundi was estimated by the United Nations to have a population of 10,524,117 people, compared to only 2,456,000 in 1950.<br> 
The population growth rate is 2.5 percent per year, more than double the average global pace, and a Burundian woman has on average 6.3 children, nearly triple the international fertility rate.<br> 
Burundi had the fifth highest total fertility rate in the world in 2012.<br>

Many Burundians have migrated to other countries as a result of the civil war. In 2006, the United States accepted approximately 10,000 Burundian refugees.<br>

Burundi remains an overwhelmingly rural society, with just 13% of the population living in urban areas in 2013. The population density of around 315 people per square kilometre (753 per sq mi) is the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. <br>
Roughly 85% of the population are of Hutu ethnic origin, 15% are Tutsi and fewer than 1% are indigenous Twa.</p>
<div class="culture">
<h6 class="nice">Culture</h6>
</div>
<p>The culture of Burundi is based on local tradition and common influence with its neighbors.<br>
Traditional drumming of karyenda is an important part of Burundian cultural heritage, as indicated by the world-famous Royal Drummers of Burundi.<br> 
Traditional dance often accompanies the drumming, which is frequently seen in celebrations and family gatherings. Some Burundian artisans have special songs to accompany different stages of their work.<br
