  My country is called <strong>Burundi</strong>.<br>
  It is an <em>East African</em> country without access to the sea, but with a large shoreline on Lake Tanganyika.<br>
  it is located in the Great Lakes region and surrounded by the Democratic Republic of Congo to the west, Rwanda to the north, and Tanzania to the east and south.<br> 
  Its capital is, since February 4, 2019, Gitega. Bujumbura, the former capital and the most populous city in the country, is the economic capital.
Burundi's economy is predominantly rural and is based on agricultural exports and livestock.<br> 
Agricultural production is divided between products for export, such as coffee, tea and cotton, and food crops.<br> 
The coffee sector is the country's leading resource (80% of exports).<br> 
Burundi is also the eighth in the list of African tea producers at the beginning of the decade 2010, dominated by Kenya.</p>
