# Week 2 Project

This week's project is a bit different from the last weeks' projects.  Your web page will be larger and more complex than the last two sites you made, but you'll be following [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw) by Traversy Media. Mr. Traversy is one of the best coaches on YouTube so you're in good hands!

But wait.  A working website is not a finished project!

We still expect your Week 3 project to be broken down into working steps with a table in the ```index.html``` to describe your user stories, and for each step to be saved separately in it's own folder.  Only this time we don't tell you what the steps are!  Part of your assignment is to decide when one user story begins and the next ends.  (We won't even tell you how many user stories there are ;)

You'll get a chance in class next Sunday to discuss the different ways this project an be broken down into user stories.
