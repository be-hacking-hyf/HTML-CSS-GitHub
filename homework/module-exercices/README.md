## HTML & CSS Exercises (ilhan koral)

This folder contains my Module 1 exercises, which I add HTML code and also styled as I like. I added particular code inside a dive which has class name "box". Because my own pages has header, time to time I intentionally ommit header element if challange has header element.

Moreover you may want to check my **freeCodeCamp public profile** [right here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ilhankoral).
