  <h2>DuckDuckGo</h2>
  <p>
    Replicate <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> using just HTML & CSS. Users should be
    able to type into the search bar, but nothing needs to happen when they hit "enter".</p>
  </p>

  <p> Be sure to use <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Inspect_and_select_colors"
      target="_blank">the same colors</a>, <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/copy-image-web-address-url-1174175"
      target="_blank">the same images</a>, and <a
      href="https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-see-what-fonts-a-website-is-using/" target="_blank">the same
      font</a> as DuckDuckGo.
