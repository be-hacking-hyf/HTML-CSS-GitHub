                    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                        <p>First thing’s first—OMG, you’re engaged! Can you tell we’re excited? But, we also know better 
                           than anyone how overwhelming wedding planning can be and we’re here to help you every step of the way.
                           We know we’ve been around for 85 years, but this is not your grandmother’s Brides.  Everyday, we meet with wedding planners, photographers, and real brides to
                           maintain an authentic and celebratory approach to weddings. We are active participants in New York 
                           Bridal Fashion Week, where we report live on trends before they break on the internet. And we stay 
                           on top of every celebrity engagement to bring you the latest ideas that you can borrow for your wedding.
                        <br>
                        <br>  
                           We’re committed to bringing you an inclusive look at the world of weddings, with every type of couple,
                           and every type of celebration. Whether you’re only just thinking about getting engaged (or hinting at
                           it and looking for the perfect ring), in the throws of wedding planning, or already navigating newlywed 
                           life, Brides is here to inspire, guide and entertain you during this exciting, and trying, time.
                           Looking for the most gorgeous wedding dress? Exactly how to word a wedding invitation? Or wondering 
                           how to propose to your bridal party? You’ve come to the right place.
