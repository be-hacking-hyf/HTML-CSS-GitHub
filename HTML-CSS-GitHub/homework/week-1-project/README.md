## Week 1 Project

To complete this week's project (a simple, interactive tic-tac-toe board) you'll need to code each user story described [in this user story table](https://be-hacking-hyf.github.io/HTML-CSS-GitHub/homework/week-1-project/). You will start by forking [this repository](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub), cloning it to your computer, and writing the HTML and CSS for each folder.  For more information on what is expected from the project you can read about weekly projects [right here](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/html-css-github/#weekly-projects).

But wait! It's not enough to have a tic-tac-toe board that workss  It's even more important that you understand how this tic-tac-toe board can be broken into small steps and developed incrementally.  To show us that you are mastering this skill you will be required to save each step of your progress in a different folder, as a fully-working (but incomplete) web site. Each step will use the previous one as a starting point.

Take a look at the completed example to get an idea of what a finished project looks like, notice that each folder has code in it and each row in the table links to a working web page:
* [it's source code](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/HTML-CSS-GitHub/tree/master/study-code/example-project-feedback-form)
* [the live example](https://be-hacking-hyf.github.io/HTML-CSS-GitHub/study-code/example-project-feedback-form/)


When you've written your code for each folder, tested the table and each page on your computer, have pushed your work to your github account, _and_ turned on GitHub pages, you're ready to turn in your homework!  You can find instructions for homework submission [right here](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/html-css-github/wiki/Homework-Submission).
