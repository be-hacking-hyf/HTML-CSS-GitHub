## Study Code

This folder contains code for you to study.  We agree, it's well-named.

While video tutorials and articles can be very helpful while first getting started in programming, you'll never be fully confident until you are confident reading and studying from code directly.

So here you have it! a folder full of finished projects, code-alongs, and helpful examples to learn to program directly from your coaches fingers.
